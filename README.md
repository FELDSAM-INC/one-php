This library provides you with XML-RPC client, which parses XML responses to an array.  
You can traverse over it by using dot notation.  
We generated all public methods from [api.rst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenNebula/docs/master/source/development_guide/system_interfaces/api.rst) file.

Check example method with doc block. For more, check [src/One.php](https://github.com/FELDSAM-INC/one-php/blob/master/src/One.php)

```
/**
 * Retrieves information for all or part of the VMs in the pool.
 *
 * @param int $a Filter flag  -4: Resources belonging to the user's primary group  -3: Resources belonging to the user  -2: All resources  -1: Resources belonging to the user and any of his groups * &gt;= 0: UID User's Resources
 * @param int $b When the next parameter is &gt;= -1 this is the Range start ID. Can be -1. For smaller values this is the offset used for pagination.
 * @param int $c For values &gt;= -1 this is the Range end ID. Can be -1 to get until the last ID. For values &lt; -1 this is the page size used for pagination.
 * @param int $d VM state to filter by.
 * @param string $e Filter in KEY=VALUE format.
 * @return \One\Resource
 */
public function vmpoolInfoextended(int $a, int $b, int $c, int $d, string $e) {
    return $this->makeCall('one.vmpool.infoextended', $a, $b, $c, $d, $e);
}
```

Your IDE will use this doc blocks, and you have handy documentation inside code. No need to look into official docs page.

## Examples

**Connect to API, create client instance**
```
$client = new \One\One('http://{IP}:2633/RPC2', 'username:password');
```

**Call some method and get response** - `\One\Resource` class instance
```
try {
    $response = $client->vmpoolInfoextended(-1, -1, -1, -1, '');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage(), "\n";
    exit(1);
}
```

**Work with response**  
`\One\Resource` class instance is wrapper over [adbario/php-dot-notation](https://packagist.org/packages/adbario/php-dot-notation)
```
$vms = $response->get('VM');

echo "Total number of VMs is " , $vms->count() , "\n";

foreach($vms->all() as $vm) {
    if (!$vm->isEmpty('USER_TEMPLATE.LABELS')) {
        echo "VM ID ", $vm->get('ID'), " has label(s): ", $vm->get('USER_TEMPLATE.LABELS'), "\n";
    } else {
        echo "VM ID ", $vm->get('ID'), " doesn't have any labels.\n";
    }
}
```

**Index result array by specific subkey**
```
$vms = $response->getIndexedBy('ID', 'VM');
// get VM with ID 2403
$vm = $vms->get(2403);
```
