# OpenNebula API Bindings for PHP

It parses XML responses to array. You can traverse over it by using dot notation.
We generated public methods with docs from api.rst file.

## Examples

**Connect to API, create client instance**
```
$client = new \One\One('http://{IP}:2633/RPC2', 'username:password');
```

**Call some method and get response** - `\One\Resource` class instance
```
try {
    $response = $client->vmpoolInfoextended(-1, -1, -1, -1, '');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage(), "\n";
    exit(1);
}
```

**Work with response**  
`\One\Resource` class instance is wrapper over [adbario/php-dot-notation](https://packagist.org/packages/adbario/php-dot-notation)
```
$vms = $response->get('VM');

echo "Total number of VMs is " , $vms->count() , "\n";

foreach($vms->all() as $vm) {
    if (!$vm->isEmpty('USER_TEMPLATE.LABELS')) {
        echo "VM ID ", $vm->get('ID'), " has label(s): ", $vm->get('USER_TEMPLATE.LABELS'), "\n";
    } else {
        echo "VM ID ", $vm->get('ID'), " doesn't have any labels.\n";
    }
}
```

**Index result array by specific subkey**
```
$vms = $response->getIndexedBy('ID', 'VM');
// get VM with ID 2403
$vm = $vms->get(2403);
```
